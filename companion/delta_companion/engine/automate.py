"""Game-client automation: drive 三角洲行动 to look up a player by ID and snap
the 4 profile screens, then return their paths so the existing OCR pipeline can
ingest them.

Design choices to reduce anti-cheat signature/behavioural risk:
* No process injection, no memory reads — pure OS-level input + desktop capture.
* Pixel positions are not hard-coded and (almost) no manual calibration is
  needed. Most controls in the flow are Chinese **text** labels (加好友 / 个人信息
  / 详细数据 / 数据总览 / 排位赛数据 / 历史战绩), so at run time the bot screenshots
  the live game, OCRs the whole frame with the already-installed RapidOCR, finds
  the on-screen text of the control it wants and clicks its centre. A cropped
  reference image (`cv2.matchTemplate`) is only an **optional fallback** for the
  rare control that has no text (e.g. the search box / the first result row).
* Every action is wrapped in a gaussian-randomised pause; mouse moves use a
  curved tween with tiny per-step jitter; keystrokes have variable spacing.
  The bot will look mechanical to a careful observer but should not stick out
  on simple timing heuristics.
* Failsafe: pyautogui.FAILSAFE remains TRUE — slamming the mouse into a screen
  corner aborts the script instantly.

The bot is NOT a guarantee against bans. The user has been told.
